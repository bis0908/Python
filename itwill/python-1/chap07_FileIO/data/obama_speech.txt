[] obama hello skybrookapplauseit's good to be homeapplausethank you everybodyapplausethank youapplausethank youapplausethank you so much thank you thank you thank youapplauseit's good to be homethank youapplausewe're on live tv here i've got to moveapplauseyou can tell that i'm a lame duck because nobody is following instructionslaughtereverybody have a seatmy fellow americans michelle and i have been so touched by all the well-wishes that we've received over the past few weeks but tonight it's my turn to say thankswhether we have seen eye-to-eye or rarely agreed at all my conversations with you the american people -- in living rooms and in schools at farms and on factory floors at diners and on distant military outposts -- those conversations are what have kept me honest and kept me inspired and kept me going and every day i have learned from you you made me a better president and you made me a better manso i first came to chicago when i was in my early twenties and i was still trying to figure out who i was still searching for a purpose to my life and it was a neighborhood not far from here where i began working with church groups in the shadows of closed steel millsit was on these streets where i witnessed the power of faith and the quiet dignity of working people in the face of struggle and losscrowd chanting "four more years"i can't do thatnow this is where i learned that change only happens when ordinary people get involved and they get engaged and they come together to demand itafter eight years as your president i still believe that and it's not just my belief it's the beating heart of our american idea -- our bold experiment in self-governmentit's the conviction that we are all created equal endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights among them life liberty and the pursuit of happinessit's the insistence that these rights while self-evident have never been self-executing that we the people through the instrument of our democracy can form a more perfect unionwhat a radical idea the great gift that our founders gave to us the freedom to chase our individual dreams through our sweat and toil and imagination -- and the imperative to strive together as well to achieve a common good a greater goodfor years our nation's call to citizenship has given work and purpose to each new generation it's what led patriots to choose republic over tyranny pioneers to trek west slaves to brave that makeshift railroad to freedomit's what pulled immigrants and refugees across oceans and the rio grande it's what pushed women to reach for the ballot it's what powered workers to organize it's why gis gave their lives at omaha beach and iwo jima iraq and afghanistan -- and why men and women from selma to stonewall were prepared to give theirs as wellapplauseso that's what we mean when we say america is exceptional not that our nation has been flawless from the start but that we have shown the capacity to change and make life better for those who followyes our progress has been uneven the work of democracy has always been hard it has been contentious sometimes it has been bloody for every two steps forward it often feels we take one step back but the long sweep of america has been defined by forward motion a constant widening of our founding creed to embrace all and not just someapplauseif i had told you eight years ago that america would reverse a great recession reboot our auto industry and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history -- if i had told you that we would open up a new chapter with the cuban people shut down iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot take out the mastermind of - -- if i had told you that we would win marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another million of our fellow citizens -- if i had told you all that you might have said our sights were set a little too highbut that's what we did that's what you did you were the change the answer to people's hopes and because of you by almost every measure america is a better stronger place than it was when we startedin days the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy no no no no no the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next i committed to president-elect trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition just as president bush did for mebecause it's up to all of us to make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still face we have what we need to do so we have everything we need to meet those challenges after all we remain the wealthiest most powerful and most respected nation on earthour youth our drive our diversity and openness our boundless capacity for risk and reinvention means that the future should be ours but that potential will only be realized if our democracy works only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people only if all of us regardless of party affiliation or particular interests help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right nowand that's what i want to focus on tonight the state of our democracy understand democracy does not require uniformity our founders argued they quarreled and eventually they compromised they expected us to do the same but they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity the idea that for all our outward differences we're all in this together that we rise or fall as onethere have been moments throughout our history that threatened that solidarity and the beginning of this century has been one of those times a shrinking world growing inequality demographic change and the specter of terrorism these forces haven't just tested our security and our prosperity but are testing our democracy as well and how we meet these challenges to our democracy will determine our ability to educate our kids and create good jobs and protect our homelandin other words it will determine our future to begin with our democracy won't work without a sense that everyone has economic opportunityapplauseand the good news is that today the economy is growing again wages incomes home values and retirement accounts are all rising again poverty is falling againapplausethe wealthy are paying a fair share of taxes even as the stock market shatters records the unemployment rate is near a -year low the uninsured rate has never ever been lowerapplausehealth care costs are rising at the slowest rate in years and i've said and i mean it anyone can put together a plan that is demonstrably better than the improvements we've made to our health care system that covers as many people at less cost i will publicly support itapplausebecause that after all is why we serve not to score points or take credit but to make people's lives betterapplausebut for all the real progress that we've made we know it's not enough our economy doesn't work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class and ladders for folks who want to get into the middle classapplausethat's the economic argument but stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic idea while the top percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income too many of our families in inner cities and in rural counties have been left behindthe laid off factory worker the waitress or health care worker who's just barely getting by and struggling to pay the bills convinced that the game is fixed against them that their government only serves the interest of the powerful that's a recipe for more cynicism and polarization in our politicsnow there're no quick fixes to this long-term trend i agree our trade should be fair and not just free but the next wave of economic dislocations won't come from overseas it will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle class jobs obsoleteand so we're going to have to forge a new social compact to guarantee all our kids the education they needapplauseto give workers the powerapplauseto unionize for better wagescheersto update the social safety net to reflect the way we live nowapplauseand make more reforms to the tax code so corporations and the individuals who reap the most from this new economy don't avoid their obligations to the country that's made their very success possiblecheersapplausewe can argue about how to best achieve these goals but we can't be complacent about the goals themselves for if we don't create opportunity for all people the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to comethere's a second threat to our democracy and this one is as old as our nation itselfafter my election there was talk of a post-racial america and such a vision however well intended was never realistic race remains a potentapplauseand often divisive force in our societynow i've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were or or years ago no matter what some folks sayapplauseyou can see it not just in statistics you see it in the attitudes of young americans across the political spectrum but we're not where we need to be and all of us have more work to doapplauseif every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclavesapplauseif we're unwilling to invest in the children of immigrants just because they don't look like us we will diminish the prospects of our own children -- because those brown kids will represent a larger and larger share of america's workforceapplauseand we have shown that our economy doesn't have to be a zero-sum game last year incomes rose for all races all age groups for men and for womenso if we're going to be serious about race going forward we need to uphold laws against discrimination -- in hiring and in housing and in education and in the criminal justice systemapplausethat is what our constitution and highest ideals requirebut laws alone won't be enough hearts must change it won't change overnight social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change but if our democracy is to work the way it should in this increasingly diverse nation then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in american fiction atticus finch who said "you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view until you climb into his skin and walk around in it"for blacks and other minority groups that means tying our own very real struggles for justice to the challenges that a lot of people in this country face not only the refugee or the immigrant or the rural poor or the transgender american but also the middle-aged white guy who from the outside may seem like he's got all the advantages but has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological changewe have to pay attention and listenapplausefor white americans it means acknowledging that the effects of slavery and jim crow didn't suddenly vanish in the 's that when minority groups voice discontent they're not just engaging in reverse racism or practicing political correctness when they wage peaceful protest they're not demanding special treatment but the equal treatment that our founders promisedapplausefor native-born americans it means reminding ourselves that the stereotypes about immigrants today were said almost word for word about the irish and italians and poles who it was said were going to destroy the fundamental character of america and as it turned out america wasn't weakened by the presence of these newcomers these newcomers embraced this nation's creed and this nation was strengthenedapplauseso regardless of the station we occupy we all have to try harder we all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do that they value hard work and family just like we do that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our ownapplausecheeringand that's not easy to do for too many of us it's become safer to retreat into our own bubbles whether in our neighborhoods or on college campuses or places of worship or especially our social media feeds surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions in the rise of naked partisanship and increasing economic and regional stratification the splintering of our media into a channel for every taste all this makes this great sorting seem natural even inevitableand increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information whether it's true or not that fits our opinions instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out thereapplauseand this trend represents a third threat to our democracy look politics is a battle of ideas that's how our democracy was designed in the course of a healthy debate we prioritize different goals and the different means of reaching them but without some common baseline of facts without a willingness to admit new information and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point and that science and reason matter then we're going to keep talking past each othercrowd cheersand we'll make common ground and compromise impossible and isn't that part of what so often makes politics dispiriting how can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on pre-school for kids but not when we're cutting taxes for corporationshow do we excuse ethical lapses in our own party but pounce when the other party does the same thing it's not just dishonest it's selective sorting of the facts it's self-defeating because as my mom used to tell me reality has a way of catching up with youtake the challenge of climate change in just eight years we've halved our dependence on foreign oil we've doubled our renewable energy we've led the world to an agreement that at the promise to save this planetapplausebut without bolder action our children won't have time to debate the existence of climate change they'll be busy dealing with its effects more environmental disasters more economic disruptions waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary now we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem but to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations it betrays the essential spirit of this country the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our founderscrowd cheersit is that spirit -- it is that spirit born of the enlightenment that made us an economic powerhouse the spirit that took flight at kitty hawk and cape canaveral the spirit that cures disease and put a computer in every pocket it's that spirit a faith in reason and enterprise and the primacy of right over might that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the great depression that allowed us to build a post-world war ii order with other democraciesan order based not just on military power or national affiliations but built on principles the rule of law human rights freedom of religion and speech and assembly and an independent pressapplausethat order is now being challenged first by violent fanatics who claim to speak for islam more recently by autocrats in foreign capitals who seek free markets in open democracies and civil society itself as a threat to their powerthe peril each poses to our democracy is more far reaching than a car bomb or a missile they represent the fear of change the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders accountable an intolerance of dissent and free thought a belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter of what's true and what's rightbecause of the extraordinary courage of our men and women in uniform because of our intelligence officers and law enforcement and diplomats who support our troopsapplauseno foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight yearscheersapplauseand althoughapplauseboston and orlando and san bernardino and fort hood remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever we have taken out tens of thousands of terrorists including bin ladencheersapplausethe global coalition we're leading against isil has taken out their leaders and taken away about half their territory isil will be destroyed and no one who threatens america will ever be safecheersapplauseand all who serve or have served -- it has been the honor of my lifetime to be your commander-in-chiefcheersand we all owe you a deep debt of gratitudecheersapplausebut protecting our way of life that's not just the job of our military democracy can buckle when it gives into fear so just as we as citizens must remain vigilant against external aggression we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we areapplauseand that's why for the past eight years i've worked to put the fight against terrorism on a firmer legal footing that's why we've ended torture worked to close gitmo reformed our laws governing surveillance to protect privacy and civil libertiesapplausethat's why i reject discrimination against muslim americanscheerswho are just as patriotic as we arecheersapplausethat's whyapplausethat's why we cannot withdrawapplausethat's why we cannot withdraw from big global fights to expand democracy and human rights and women's rights and lgbt rightsapplauseno matter how imperfect our efforts no matter how expedient ignoring such values may seem that's part of defending america for the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression if the scope of freedom and respect for the rule of law shrinks around the world the likelihood of war within and between nations increases and our own freedoms will eventually be threatenedso let's be vigilant but not afraid isil will try to kill innocent people but they cannot defeat america unless we betray our constitution and our principles in the fightapplauserivals like russia or china cannot match our influence around the world -- unless we give up what we stand for and turn ourselves into just another big country that bullies smaller neighborswhich brings me to my final point -- our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for grantedapplauseall of us regardless of party should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutionsapplausewhen voting rates in america are some of the lowest among advanced democracies we should be making it easier not harder to voteapplausewhen trust in our institutions is low we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service when congress is dysfunctional we should draw our districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremesapplausebut remember none of this happens on its own all of this depends on our participation on each of us accepting the responsibility of citizenship regardless of which way the pendulum of power happens to be swingingour constitution is a remarkable beautiful gift but it's really just a piece of parchment it has no power on its own we the people give it power we the people give it meaning -- with our participation and with the choices that we make and the alliances that we forgewhether or not we stand up for our freedoms whether or not we respect and enforce the rule of law that's up to us america is no fragile thing but the gains of our long journey to freedom are not assuredin his own farewell address george washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety prosperity and liberty but "from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth"and so we have to preserve this truth with "jealous anxiety" that we should reject "the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties" that make us oneapplauseamerica we weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive that people of good character aren't even willing to enter into public service so course with rancor that americans with whom we disagree are seen not just as misguided but as malevolent we weaken those ties when we define some of us as more american than othersapplausewhen we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing themcrowd cheersit falls to each of us to be those anxious jealous guardians of our democracy embrace the joyous task we have been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours because for all our outward differences we in fact all share the same proud type the most important office in a democracy citizenapplausecitizen so you see that's what our democracy demands it needs you not just when there's an election not just when you own narrow interest is at stake but over the full span of a lifetime if you're tired of arguing with strangers on the internet try talking with one of them in real lifeapplauseif something needs fixing then lace up your shoes and do some organizingcrowd cheersif you're disappointed by your elected officials grab a clip board get some signatures and run for office yourselfcrowd cheersshow up dive in stay at it sometimes you'll win sometimes you'll lose presuming a reservoir in goodness that can be a risk and there will be times when the process will disappoint you but for those of us fortunate enough to have been part of this one and to see it up close let me tell you it can energize and inspire and more often than not your faith in america and in americans will be confirmed mine sure has beenapplauseover the course of these eight years i've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates and our newest military officers i have mourned with grieving families searching for answers and found grace in a charleston church i've seen our scientists help a paralyzed man regain his sense of touch i've seen wounded warriors who at points were given up for dead walk againi've seen our doctors and volunteers rebuild after earthquakes and stop pandemics in their tracks i've seen the youngest of children remind us through their actions and through their generosity of our obligations to care for refugees or work for peace and above all to look out for each other so that faith that i placed all those years ago not far from here in the power of ordinary americans to bring about change that faith has been rewarded in ways i could not have possibly imaginedand i hope your faith has too some of you here tonight or watching at home you were there with us in andcheersapplausemaybe you still can't believe we pulled this whole thing offcheerslet me tell you you're not the only oneslaughtermichellecheersapplausemichelle lavaughn

were the first decision i made as a nominee and it was the bestcheersapplausenot just because you have been a great vice president but because in the bargain i gained a brother and we love you and jill like family and your friendship has been one of the great joys of our livesapplauseto my remarkable staff for eight years and for some of you a whole lot more i have drawn from your energy and every day i try to reflect back what you displayed heart and character and idealism i've watched you grow up get married have kids start incredible new journeys of your owneven when times got tough and frustrating you never let washington get the better of you you guarded against cynicism and the only thing that makes me prouder than all the good that we've done is the thought of all the amazing things that you are going to achieve from hereapplauseand to all of you out there -- every organizer who moved to an unfamiliar town every kind family who welcomed them in every volunteer who knocked on doors every young person who cast a ballot for the first time every american who lived and breathed the hard work of change -- you are the best supporters and organizers anybody could ever hope for and i will forever be grateful because you did change the worldapplauseyou didand that's why i leave this stage tonight even more optimistic about this country than when we started because i know our work has not only helped so many americans it has inspired so many americans -- especially so many young people out there -- to believe that you can make a difference to hitch your wagon to something bigger than yourselveslet me tell you this generation coming up -- unselfish altruistic creative patriotic -- i've seen you in every corner of the country you believe in a fair and just and inclusive america you know that constant change has been america's hallmark that it's not something to fear but something to embrace you are willing to carry this hard work of democracy forward you'll soon outnumber any of us and i believe as a result the future is in good handsapplausemy fellow americans it has been the honor of my life to serve you i won't stop in fact i will be right there with you as a citizen for all my remaining days but for now whether you are young or whether you're young at heart i do have one final ask of you as your president -- the same thing i asked when you took a chance on me eight years agoi am asking you to believe not in my ability to bring about change -- but in yoursi am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon a creed at the core of every american whose story is not yet written yes we canapplauseyes we didapplauseyes we canapplausethank you god bless you and may god continue to bless the united states of america thank youapplause
